# Unity2D-Game-BulletTime
Develop a 2D game. Your game should be one small complete game or one level of a potentially much larger game - giving you the opportunity to focus on game mechanics, gameplay and your design choices. Your game can be any genre you like - as long as it is in 2D, and the mechanics you explore are up to you. Your game should be original and developed through in-class prototyping and testing. Your game should be developed in Unity.

Your game will be marked on:

Game mechanics Gameplay/User Experience Game Concept Design quality Originality Evidence of Prototyping and Testing

Alongside your 2D game, you will be required to submit a 1500-word (minimum) Games Development Document. You should begin with a brief synopsis of your game concept, describing game mechanics and gameplay. You should describe any games of a similar style/genre that have influenced your game design choices. Your document must cover the planning, design, development and testing of your finished game. Include a record of any paper prototyping/design iterations, testing - including feedback and how you acted on feedback. You may choose to record the prototyping phases in photographs and/or film. You should include any concept art, asset creation or designs - e.g. storyboard, level map, character design.

Your Games Development Document should be fully referenced. You must also include any references for code or game assets you have used that are not your own or you have adapted for use.

You must include a video walkthrough of your completed game and then explain the technical aspect.

Deliverables

2D Game and Game Development Document

Your game must be 2D, a published build, tested on the Windows operating system before submission. Alongside your 2D game you must submit a Unity Project Folder including all of your game assets and scripts, images, sprites, sounds - and any supplementary assets e.g. fonts.

You must submit a walkthrough video of your game.

Your games should include some of your own assets, however we also recommend checking out assets on the Unity Asset Store - and other sites including itch.io. The assets you use must be referenced in the Game Development Document.

In this module you should not just rely on the Unity Packs for 2D games. We expect you may use common prefabs containing scripts, for example a Character Controller, but for other behaviours you should write your own scripts.

If you are unsure - ask!

The Game Development Document

Your games must be accompanied by a Game Development Document of a minimum of 1500 words (there is no maximum word count).

Your game development document should consist of the following elements:

Title: Your game should have a name! Abstract: a brief synopsis of your game concept, describing key game mechanics and gameplay. Game rules: A description of the rules, and game structure you have chosen and why you have made those choices. Context: Evidence of any games, of a similar style or genre, that have inspired your game design. Evidence of design: This should include concept artwork, character design, level design, narrative design etc. Prototyping, Testing and Feedback: Evidence of prototyping and iterative design (this should include: screenshots, paper prototypes, photos and or videos) test plan, test data and evidence of testing (e.g. screenshots, photos and or videos). Technical Description: A description of any of the key techniques or technical challenges you have encountered in developing your game. Critical Reflection: An open and detailed evaluation of your game that notes what is compelling about the work, what could be improved, and what you need to learn to make these improvements. Bibliography and references: A bibliography listing any games, films, texts etc. that have inspired your game. Your Game Design Document should be fully referenced.

Submission

Please follow the submission instructions below. Work that is submitted incorrectly may not be accepted or could incur a points penalty.

Before submitting have you…

Checked that any digital work is functioning as expected? Spell-checked and grammar-checked any written work that accompanies your digital work? Please make an appointment with the Writing and Learning Centre or speak to your tutor if you are experiencing challenges in this area. Formatted your written work to the specification below? Referenced all sources of information accurately? Please refer to www.citethemrightonline.com (Harvard) for guidance.

Your work must be submitted via Turnitin. Please adhere to the following method:

Log into your university Google Drive account. Create a folder for your project. Call it something meaningful. Upload your work to your new folder. Right click your folder, select ‘Get Shareable Link’, turn on ‘Link Sharing’ and then copy the URL provided. Paste the URL into a Word document (please do not include your name for the purposes of anonymous marking). Attach any required written work (e.g. development documents) to your Word document. Log into Minerva, go to the Assessment folder and submit your Word document via the appropriate Turnitin link.

Format

Your game should be handed in as a ‘built’ executable file for PC. You will receive instructions on the process for this. Be sure to follow them, otherwise you may miss critical files. You must also hand in a complete Unity Project File, including Assets and Scripts, for both games. Your game should be handed in with a video walkthrough.

All written work must conform to university styling and submission guidelines. They must:

Contain appropriate in-text citation that supplies an accurate list of references. Be accurate in referencing. See Bath Spa guidelines and the Harvard system described at www.citethemrightonline.com. Be accurate in spelling and paragraphing.
